# Example models

Several examples for using the unscented Kalman filter are provided.

## Position tracking

- State: Position
- Measurement: Position

### Moving in a loop

- Input: Measurements in a loop

## Position and velocity tracking

- State: Position and velocity
- Measurement: Position

### Moving in a loop with velocity

- Input: Measurements in a loop

### Curved path with noise

- Input: Measurements in a rough curve with Gaussian noise
