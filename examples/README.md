# Example models

Several examples for using the unscented Kalman filter are provided.

## Moving in a loop

- State: Position
- Measurement: Position
- Input: Measurements in a loop

## Moving in a loop with velocity

- State: Position and velocity
- Measurement: Position
- Input: Measurements in a loop

## Curved path with noise

- State: Position and velocity
- Measurement: Position
- Input: Measurements in a rough curve with Gaussian noise
